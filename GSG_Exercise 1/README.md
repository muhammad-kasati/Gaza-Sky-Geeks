# Mohammad Khasati - Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project is a representation of my work and skills, designed entirely in HTML. It is my first assignment for Gaza Sky Geeks, created as a platform to showcase my web development journey and personal projects.

## About the Project

This project demonstrates the fundamental structure of a webpage, utilizing semantic HTML to organize content such as an "About Me" section, a project gallery, and a contact page. It is designed to be simple, accessible, and informative, providing visitors with a clear view of who I am and the projects I have worked on.
